Fit acoustic glitches in low-degree p-mode frequencies using the PIKAIA genetic
algorithm.

== Description ==

The program fits the signal due to the acoustic glitches at the base of the 
convection zone and at the Helium second ionization region that is present in
the second frequency differences.
See Houdek&Gough (2007), Mazumdar et al. (2012) for details.

It considers the functional forms for the signals as presented in 
Mazumdar et al. (2012), with a total of 7 free parameters in the fit:

* A_bcz
* tau_bcz
* phi_bcz

* A_HeIIz
* beta_HeIIz
* tau_HeIIz
* phi_HeIIz


== Compilation ==

1. In the Makefile, change 'BASE' to the directory where you have the sig_genetic folder.
2. Also change 'lib' to the directory where the library is
    OR
   Place "libmodules.a" in the sig_genetic folder and set 'lib' to the same value as 'BASE'
